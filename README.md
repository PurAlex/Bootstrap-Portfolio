# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This project was created from scratch using **Bootstrap**. I recreate my previous portfolio and I implement new things that I learned. 

I encounter one challenge in this project, and it was the icons on the footer. I wasn't able to change the blue link color to any color that I want, after a research I found the problem and solve it.

I enjoyed creating this project and definely bootstrap reduce the time of the creation of the project.
